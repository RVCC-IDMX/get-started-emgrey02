# Get Started Page

This web page was first designed in [Figma](https://figma.com) following [Angela's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_TjoSnaI3CTgIgmSn3rruA) youtube video called [Figma Web Design Tutorial | Figma UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYCesPcxpEw).

I recreated what Angela made in her video, with slight alterations in color and layout. In addition to a desktop version of the website, I added a tablet and mobile version. Here is a link to my [Figma Creation](https://www.figma.com/file/JS4sk1A6HBr9Y6dMiGDjCI/First-Figma-Design?node-id=0%3A1).

From there, I translated the design to code - using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Website features:
- responsive to every screen size
- fluid typography
- variable font: Montserrat
- scroll animation
- nav link hover animation
